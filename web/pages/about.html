    <h1>About me!</h1>
    <div class="center">
        <p class="about">My name is <span class="color">Dawid</span>, and before getting into
            coding i was full time music producer. I was making music as my job for 5 years straight but I gave up on
            beacuse I got burned out.
        </p>
        <p class="about">To fulfill my <span class="color">creative soul</span> I decided to give coding a shot.
            My journey started originally in July 2023, around that time I picked up my first <a class="hover-link"
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Absolute-Beginner-3rd/dp/1435455002">Python book</a>.
            It was enough to teach me fundamentals about Python, but it haven't gave me this <span
                class="color">spark</span> to continue learning. I was coding small things on and off for the rest of
            the
            year. In January 2024 I found <span class="color">CS50P</span>. Which I finished coding small things on in
            March same year. After
            this course I really found intrest in coding and wanted to develop all kind of cool things. But my issue
            with Python was that in order to find thing necessary to build thing that I want to do, I had to spend
            hours googling for
            library that will make it possible.
            I found this really annoying.
        <p>
        <p class="about">
            So in April I gave <span class="color">Go</span> a shot, and after some initial
            struggle
            I picked up the basics and since then I develop all of my projects in Go.
