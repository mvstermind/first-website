            Hi there!</h1>
        <p>My name is <span class="text-teal-300">Mvstermind</span> and I'm teaching myself how to code.</p>
        <p>I picked it up from pure curiosity and I instantly fell in love with it. Even tho it's just the beginning of
            my journey I have a lot of fun coding and learning about diffrent kind of crazy technologies.</p>
        <p class="">I build things mostly in Go, but I'd also would like to build something with <span
                class="text-teal-300">Vue.js</span> or <span class="text-teal-300">Htmx</span> beacuse them seem very
            fun to work with (especially htmx).</p>
        <p>Here is <a class="text-teal-300 hover:underline" href="/about">about me</a> page. There I tell more about my
            background, how I got into coding etc.</p>
